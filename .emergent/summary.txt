<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully progressed the Espacios Con Piscina application by addressing user-reported bugs and implementing significant feature enhancements. Key accomplishments include fixing an expense display bug caused by singular/plural mismatches, enhancing expense management with dynamic sorting (by date, urgency, villa, owner, invoice number, remaining balance), implementing grouped totals by expense type, and adding a month-based filter. The system now seamlessly displays overdue expenses from previous months in the current view. Multi-selection with bulk deletion was added across Customers, Reservations, Villas, and Categories. Form persistence post-save was implemented for efficient data entry. Manual invoice numbering for admins was introduced, along with an auto-incrementing, duplicate-checking system for employees. Finally, an Excel-based data import/export system was initiated, with the export functionality and template generation completed, and the import processing currently underway.

<product_requirements>
The Espacios Con Piscina application aims to manage villas, reservations, clients, and expenses with role-based access. Initially, it required a robust reservation/client system with payment tracking and customizable invoices (multi-currency, extra services, starting numbers). Villa management needed , , , , optional ITBIS, an expense tracker, and a statistical dashboard.

Evolving requirements led to:
1.  **Invoice Enhancements**: Professional redesign with logo, ID fields, custom fields, and an in-app .
2.  **Villa/Services Revamp**: Separate management for villas and services.
3.  **Partial Payments (Abonos)**: For reservations and expenses.
4.  **Advanced Expense Management**: User-creatable categories, payment reminders, grouping. New additions included:
    *   Ordering by reservation date, prioritizing upcoming/overdue.
    *   Separating Fixed/Variable/Unique expenses (with Unique having no payment dates).
    *   New compromiso category for fixed/recurring expenses.
    *   Month-based filtering and aggregated totals per type.
    *   Showing pending expenses from previous months in the current month's view.
    *   Advanced filters: by invoice number, villa, owner, remaining balance.
5.  **Cascade Deletion for Reservations** and **Deletion of Auto-Generated Expenses**.
6.  **Customer Management**: Optional , search feature, and alphabetical listing.
7.  **User Management**: Admin role to create users and assign roles.
8.  **Application Deployment**: Shifted from desktop  to a web-based solution.
9.  **Dynamic Logo Management**: In-app uploader for application header and invoices.
10. **Bulk Operations**: Multi-selection and mass deletion for Customers, Reservations, Villas, and Categories.
11. **Form Persistence**: Forms to remain open and clear after saving new entries.
12. **Manual Invoice Numbering (Admin Only)**: Admins can manually set invoice numbers, while others get auto-generated, duplicate-checked numbers.
13. **Data Import/Export**: System to export data/template and import historical invoices via Excel, with auto-generation of associated expenses.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing a comprehensive **Export/Import System** for reservation data using Excel templates, as requested by the user.

**Current state of work:**
1.  **Backend ( & ):**
    *   A new file  was created to house functions for generating an invoice template () and exporting existing reservation data () into Excel format.
    *   The main  was updated to include new API endpoints:
        *    (GET) to allow users to download a pre-formatted Excel template.
        *    (GET) to export all existing reservation data.
    *   Required Python libraries  and  were installed and added to .
    *   An import error () was identified and fixed by adjusting the import statement in  to be relative.
2.  **Frontend ():**
    *   A new section Importar/Exportar Datos was added to the  component.
    *   This section currently includes two buttons: Descargar Plantilla de Facturas and Exportar Reservaciones, which successfully trigger the corresponding backend export endpoints.
3.  **Import System Initialization:**
    *   The user clarified that upon importing invoices via Excel, associated owner expenses should be automatically generated, and the user will manually mark them as paid later (OPCION A).
    *   A new file  has been created, and the  endpoint has been added to .
    *   The AI engineer is currently in the process of adding the corresponding Importar Reservaciones button to the  frontend component to complete the UI for the import functionality. The backend processing logic for import is yet to be fully implemented.
</current_work>
